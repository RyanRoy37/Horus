# HORUS ðŸ¦…

HORUS is a Flutter-based mobile app built for bird watchers that helps you **identify bird species** using your camera or photo uploads and provides detailed information on birds commonly found in Bengaluru. Designed for nature enthusiasts, HORUS combines **AI-powered image recognition** with a curated local bird database.

---

## Integration with OSEA Model

HORUS leverages the **OSEA Mobile** offline bird identification system, which uses pretrained AI models for detection and classification:

- **Detection:** Uses pretrained `ssd mobilenet` for bird detection.
- **Classification:** Employs a `ResNet34` based model trained via MetaFGNet on the DongNiao DIB-10K dataset.

The model files and assets come from the OSEA project, including:

- `bird_model.onnx` (quantized version of the classification model)
- `ssd_mobilenet.onnx` (quantized detection model)
- Bird info JSON and database files with curated bird data

You can download all necessary OSEA assets by running the provided script:

./assets_download.sh
